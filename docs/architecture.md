# Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture

## Overview

This document outlines the complete architecture for a Multi-Tenant SaaS Web Application using Supabase as the backend infrastructure. The architecture is designed to support multiple tenant organizations, each with their own sites, content, and users, while maintaining strict data isolation and security.

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Authentication Layer
- **Provider**: Supabase Auth
- **Methods**: 
  - Email/Magic Link authentication
  - Social authentication (Google, GitHub, etc.)
  - Single Sign-On (SSO) for enterprise customers
- **User Management**: Role-based access control with tenant-scoped permissions

### 2. Data Layer
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres with Row Level Security (RLS)
- **Multi-tenancy**: Account-based tenant isolation
- **Security**: RLS policies ensure data isolation between tenants
- **Schema**: Normalized design with clear tenant boundaries

### 3. Storage Layer
- **Provider**: Supabase Storage
- **Organization**: Tenant-specific bucket paths
- **Content Types**: Images, videos, documents, draft content
- **Security**: Bucket-level permissions aligned with tenant access

### 4. Real-time & Automation
- **Triggers**: Supabase Edge Functions for async processing
- **Webhooks**: Real-time notifications on data changes
- **Task Processing**: Queue-based background job processing

## Frontend Architecture

### Next.js Application
- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Supabase client for real-time data
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth integration
- **Features**:
  - Multi-tenant dashboard
  - Content studio and editor
  - Scheduling and automation tools
  - Billing integration (Stripe via Supabase extensions)

### User Interface Components
- Tenant-aware routing and navigation
- Role-based feature access
- Real-time collaboration features
- Responsive design for all device types

## Backend Services

### Worker Service Architecture
- **Deployment**: Container-based (Fly.io/Fargate) or Supabase Functions
- **Task Processing**: Polling or real-time channel listeners
- **Integrations**: GitHub API, content processing, deployment automation

### Job Types and Processing
- **UPLOAD_CONTENT**: Convert and process user uploads
- **GENERATE_CONTENT**: AI-powered content generation
- **REBUILD_SITE**: Trigger site rebuilds and deployments
- **RESEARCH**: Automated research and content enhancement

## GitHub Integration

### Repository Management
- **Template**: Hugo multi-site pattern under `sites/` directory
- **Per-Tenant**: Each tenant gets a dedicated repository
- **Automation**: GitHub App integration for repository management

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Build Process**: GitHub Actions for Hugo site generation
- **Deployment**: Multi-target (GitHub Pages, S3, CDN)
- **Monitoring**: Build status tracking and notifications

## Security & Compliance

### Data Isolation
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- Tenant-scoped API access
- Encrypted storage and transmission

### Access Control
- Role-based permissions
- API key management per tenant
- Audit logging for compliance

## Scalability Considerations

### Database Performance
- Proper indexing strategies
- Query optimization for multi-tenant patterns
- Connection pooling and caching

### Infrastructure Scaling
- Horizontal scaling for worker services
- CDN integration for global content delivery
- Load balancing for high availability

## Integration Points

### Third-Party Services
- **Stripe**: Payment processing and subscription management
- **GitHub**: Repository management and CI/CD
- **AI Services**: Content generation and enhancement
- **Analytics**: Usage tracking and insights

### API Design
- RESTful API with tenant context
- GraphQL for complex queries
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

## Monitoring & Observability

### Application Monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Performance monitoring
- User analytics and usage patterns

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Database performance metrics
- Worker service health checks
- Storage usage and optimization
