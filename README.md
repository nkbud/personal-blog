# Personal Blog - Multi-Tenant SaaS Architecture

An automated personal blog site serving as a reference implementation for a Multi-Tenant SaaS Web App using Supabase. This repository demonstrates the architectural patterns and implementation strategies for building scalable, multi-tenant blog and project platforms.

## Architecture Overview

This project implements a comprehensive Multi-Tenant SaaS architecture that can be reused for similar blog or project platforms. The architecture leverages modern cloud-native technologies and follows best practices for multi-tenancy, security, and scalability.

### Key Components

- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with support for email/magic-link, social login, and SSO
- **Database**: Supabase Postgres with Row Level Security (RLS) for tenant isolation
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage with tenant-specific bucket organization
- **Real-time**: Supabase Edge Functions for async triggers and webhooks
- **Frontend**: Next.js with Supabase JS for dashboard and content management
- **Backend**: Automated worker services for content processing and deployment
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions integration for automated site building and deployment
